# SalemServer
A server for a Salem gamemode written in C#

This is a project intended to replicate the game and playstyle of the strategic game Mafia, heavily inspired by BlankMediaGames' own version of it which is fondly known as Town of Salem.

I'm working on creating my own implementation of this popular game as both a challenge and a way to expand my programming skills.

Prior to starting this project, I knew nothing about C#, html, javascript or css. I did however know Java which is a pretty similar langauge to C#.

I would have attempted to work on the in C++ if it wasn't so recommended to write it in C# as the serversided langauge. It was also recommended to use Java, however I already know Java.

Perhaps in the future I may start another project which I can use C++ in.
